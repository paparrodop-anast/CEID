#### Object Oriented Programming I

This repository contains two assignments of the course Object Oriented Programming I. Through these series of exercises we were at first familiarized with the basic features of Java and then experiment on them via specific tasks.

Each assignment itself consists of a set of exercises(Set1 and Set3 that are included in the folders above) along with some of the lab exercises.
