#### Languages Technology

This repository contains the project of the course Languages Technology and was executed in collaboration with [Giannis Giannoudakis](https://github.com/giannoudak) and Fotis Hantzis.

The goal of the first part of the project was to create an inverted index for 1000 texts taken from Wikipedia. In this index, which is in XML format, we submit a series of queries and we calculate the average search time.
At first we implemented a tokenization process in every text in which all the elements of the texts were identified also with the help of the TreeTagger. Next we ended up to some ignored lemmas in which we eliminated from the process some elements like punctuation marks. So at that point we had achieved a vectorization of the texts.
