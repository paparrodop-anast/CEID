#### Scientific Computing
This repository contains the three assignments of the course Scientific Computing.

###### Assignment #1:
In this assignment we had to evaluate several basic linear algebra calculations (like LU, QR, etc), compare different implementations of a matrix-vector multiplication, and create a simple mathematical model for comparing times and efficiency.

###### Assignment #2:
In this assignment we had to check several characteristics of MATLAB, in regards to precision and arithmetic values, how numbers are stored and perform a convergance test with non-convergant series. Also, we had to specify their implications on several polynomials and related functions (like poly, roots, etc), and finally to check the backward stability of Horner's algorithm and calculate some errors.

###### Assignment #3
In this assignment I executed only the very first part, in which we had to create a matrix with a specified condition number.
