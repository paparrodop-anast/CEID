#### Digital Communications

This repository contains the two assignments of the course Digital Communications.

###### Assignment #1:
In the first assignment we had to implement both a uniform and  a non-uniform (based on Lloyd-Max algorithm) PCM quantizer, and to compare the results of several different levels of quantization of `speech.wav`. Also, using Huffman coding (its source code, `huffman.m` was provided with the assignment) and having `keimeno.txt` as input, we had to calculate the probability of each symbol of the alphabet, the entropy of the source, and Huffman's efficiency.

###### Assignment #2:
In this assignment we had to implement a simulation of a basic telecommunication system (transmitter-channel-receiver), including filters, noise, upsampling and decision modules. We used 2-PAM, 4-PAM, and 4-QAM modulation, calculated BER and then compared the different results.
