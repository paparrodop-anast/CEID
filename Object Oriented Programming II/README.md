#### Object Oriented Programming II

This repository contains the project of the course Object Oriented Programming II and was executed in collaboration with [George Kaffezas](https://github.com/gkffzs) and [Aris Magripis](https://github.com/aris-mag). The goal was the simulation of a robot fleet moving on a planet, implemented in C++.

The robot fleet consists of various types of robots (ResearchRobot, AnalysisRobot and RescueRobot), each with its respective duty and function. The planet is represented as a 2-D map in the terminal. The purpose of the simulation is the collection of the specified quantities of various resources.
