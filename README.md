This repository contains some of the projects that I have developed, alone or in collaboration with fellow students, in a series of academic courses as an undergraduate student at the [Computer Engineering & Informatics Department](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/). The majority of comments, references and descriptions are in English. Although the final reports of the projects as well as the actual assignment given by the professors are in Greek.

Note that the names of the folders are the names of the courses that the projects were included in.
Also the technologies that were used for each project are:

| Course name | Technology Used |

| Computational Linguistics | *Python* |
| Digital Communications | *MATLAB* |
| Internet Technologies | *HTML, CSS, etc.* |
| Object Oriented Programming I | *Java* |
| Object Oriented Programming II | *C++* |
| Operating Systems I | *C* |
